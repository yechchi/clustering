## Quick Start

The 'clustering' R package is implemented in R and in Rcpp.

clustering is of time complexity ***O*(*n*<sup>2</sup>)** 

This gif provides a graphical representation of its mechanisms:

### Package installation

You first need to install the `devtools` package, it can be done easily from Rstudio. We install the package from Github (remove the \# sign):

``` r
#devtools::install_github("yechchi/clustering")
library(M2algorithmique)
```

### A first simple test

We simulate simple data as follows, with `v` a vector as size `n` containing all the integers from `1` to `n` (exactly one time) in any order.

``` r
```
